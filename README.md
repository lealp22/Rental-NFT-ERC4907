# Rental NFT (ERC-4907)

**Based on [EIP-4907: Rental NFT, an Extension of EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4907). Add a time-limited role with restricted permissions to EIP-721 tokens.**

### _Be Aware:_

- This is a mock implementation. In real world you need a more in-depth security review and testing of smart-contracts before going live.

- This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with some sample contracts, a test, and a script that deploys that contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
